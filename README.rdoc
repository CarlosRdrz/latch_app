== Latch Rails APP

This rails app demos the use of devise with devise_latcheable gem (https://github.com/carlosrdrz/devise_latcheable).

It uses latch (https://latch.elevenpaths.com/) to add an extra layer of security when creating and signing in users.

Just be sure to modify config/latch.yml file with your app id and app secret key

This repo is up and running on http://latcheable.carlosrdrz.es as a demo
